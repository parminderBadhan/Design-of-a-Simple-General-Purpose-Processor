# Design-of-a-Simple-General-Purpose-Processor
FPGA Based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design: VHDL, Quartus II, Altera Board

**Project Overview:**
Developed a simple central processing unit (CPU) using VHDL, simulating and deploying it on an Altera FPGA board. The project involved designing all key CPU components including:
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- control unit (FSM + decoder)
- registers
- memory logic

The CPU cycled through instructions using a finite state machine, executed arithmetic/logical operations on two 8-bit inputs, and displayed the results live on 7-segment displays. This project deepened my understanding of hardware design, finite state machines, and digital circuit integration.

**Hardware Implementaion:**
The CPU was implemented on the Altera Cyclone-II EP2C35F672C6 FPGA board. The boardâ€™s switches and 7-segment displays were used to input data and display ALU outputs in real-time.
Allowing full hardware validation on VHDL modules including:
- FSM
- Decoder
- Registers
- ALU

**Decoder Module (VHDL):**
Developed a 4-to-16 line decoder in VHDL with an enable input for use in the custom CPU design.
- Activates one of 16 output lines based on a 4-bit input when enabled
- Uses one-hot encoding
- Integrated into the control unit to generate operation codes for the ALU based on FSM output
