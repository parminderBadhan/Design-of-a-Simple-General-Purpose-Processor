# Design-of-a-Simple-General-Purpose-Processor
FPGA Based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design: VHDL, Quartus II, Altera Board

Developed a simple central processing unit (CPU) using VHDL, simulating and deploying it on an Altera FPGA board. The project involved designing all key CPU components including an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), a control unit (FSM + decoder), registers, and memory logic. When run, the CPU cycled through instructions using a finite state machine, executed arithmetic/logical operations on two 8-bit inputs, and displayed the results live on 7-segment displays. This project deepened my understanding of hardware design, finite state machines, and digital circuit integration.
